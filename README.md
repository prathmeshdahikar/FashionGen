This application employs the StyleGAN framework, CLIP  and GANSpace exploration techniques to synthesize images of garments from textual inputs. With training based on the comprehensive LookBook dataset, it supports an efficient fashion design process by transforming text into visual concepts, showcasing the practical application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the realm of creative design.
